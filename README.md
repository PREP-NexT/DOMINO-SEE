## Overview

**DOMINO-SEE** (**D**etection Of **M**ulti-layer **IN**terconnected **O**ccurrences for **S**patial **E**xtreme **E**vents) is a data-driven statistical framework for detecting spatially co-occurrences of hydroclimatic extreme events across locations, inspired by complex network science, powered by `xarray` architecture. It's developed by [Hui-Min Wang](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5878-7542) and [Xiaogang He](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/he-xiaogang/) from the [PREP-NexT](https://github.com/PREP-NexT) Lab at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/).

This project is licensed under the [GNU General Public License 2.0](https://github.com/PREP-NexT/DOMINO-SEE/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Why the Name?

The name **DOMINO-SEE** represents our approach to detecting and analyzing interconnected occurrences of hydroclimatic extreme events across spatial locations, inspired by the cascade effect of **DOMINO**es falling in a chain reaction. The **SEE** highlights the framework's ability to capture the spatial synchronization and propagation of extreme events, emphasizing the interconnectedness inherent in complex environmental systems.

## Key Features

- **Complex Network Generation**: Fast and memory-efficient functions to build spatial networks from event series among spatial locations and multiple types (layers) of climate extreme events
- **Multi-dimensional Support**: Native support for `xarray` DataArrays to handle multi-dimensional gridded climate data
- **Parallel Processing**: `dask` integration for efficient processing of large-scale climate datasets
- **Blockwise Computation**: Utilities for splitting large spatial datasets into manageable blocks of netCDF datasets (see `dominosee/utils/blocking.py`).
- **Grid Generation**: Equidistant Fekete grid generation for alternative spatial embedding.

<!-- ## Development Status

This project is under active development. Current implementation status:

- âœ… **FeketeGrid**: Equidistant grid on a sphere - fully implemented and tested -->

The grid module is being uploaded as a work-in-progress to facilitate collaborative development. Only `BaseGrid` and `FeketeGrid` are currently recommended for production use.

## Getting Started

This section includes a brief tutorial on running your first DOMINO-SEE model.

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PREP-NexT/DOMINO-SEE.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies through conda

    ```bash
    cd DOMINO-SEE
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate dominosee
    ```

3. Install the package from source

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
