We understand the Fekete point problem in terms of the identiﬁcation of near equilibrium conﬁgurations for a potential energy that depends on the relative position of N particles.},

	abstract = {We present the new R package CoinCalc for performing event coincidence analysis (ECA), a novel statistical method to quantify the simultaneity of events contained in two series of observations, either as simultaneous or lagged coincidences within a user-speciﬁc temporal tolerance window. The package also provides diﬀerent analytical as well as surrogate-based signiﬁcance tests (valid under diﬀerent assumptions about the nature of the observed event series) as well as an intuitive visualization of the identiﬁed coincidences. We demonstrate the usage of CoinCalc based on two typical geoscientiﬁc example problems addressing the relationship between meteorological extremes and plant phenology as well as that between soil properties and land cover.},
